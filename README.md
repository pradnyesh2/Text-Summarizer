# üìÉ Text Summarizer App
This is a Streamlit-based web application that allows you to summarize content from YouTube videos, websites, or blogs by simply providing their URL. It leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Groq API to generate concise summaries, helping you quickly grasp the main points without consuming the entire content.

## ‚ú® Features

- Website/Blog Summarization: Summarize articles or blog posts from any valid website URL.
- Concise Summaries: Generates summaries of approximately 300 words.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a simple and intuitive user experience.
- API Key Integration: Securely input your Groq API key directly within the app's sidebar.

## üöÄ How to Use
- Enter your Groq API Key: In the sidebar on the left, paste your Groq API key into the "Enter your groq api key" field. This is essential for the summarization functionality.
- Provide a URL: In the main section of the app, enter the URL of the YouTube video, website, or blog post you wish to summarize.
- Get Summary: The app will automatically start summarizing the content once a valid URL and API key are provided. The summary will appear below the input field.
